# Contributing

This is only for integration testing of [cami-rs/cami](https://github.com/cami-rs/cami). Unit tests
are in the only place where they can be: under `cami` crate itself.

`lib.rs` here doesn't provide anything. See also [cami-rs/cami ->
CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/cami-rs/cami/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
